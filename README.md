# GoLang API 

## Introduction 
Since I'm new to GO programming language I took some time to scratch on the basics 
- [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com), 
- [A tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org)

Then dove in on the following 

- [Functional Programming in Go](https://medium.com/@geisonfgfg/functional-go-bc116f4c96a4)
- [Solid Design in GO](https://dave.cheney.net/2016/08/20/solid-go-design)

## Dependencies (Installation & Run)
```bash
# Mux Router
$ go get github.com/gorilla/mux
# Gorm Orm
$ go get github.com/jinzhu/gorm
```



## Docker Guideline 
To run the API use the following: 
```bash 
$ docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml up -d

$ docker-compose up
```

Dockerfile included in the project 

## Testing API Endpoints 
Endpoint                                        | Description
------------                                    | -------------
(GET)/assets                                    | endpoint to receive a user id and return a list of all the userâ€™s assets
(POST)/assets/{id}/favorite/{bool}              | endpoints that would add an asset to favourites, remove it
(PUT)/assets/{id}/description                   | edit its description



[] Note that users have no limit on how many assets they want on their favourites so your service will need to provide a reasonable response time
[] Useful and passing tests would be also be viewed favourably
[] A working server application with functional API is required
[] It is appreciated, though not required, if a Dockerfile is included.
